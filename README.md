# VSeeFaceReleases
This is a release repository used for posting releases of VSeeFace. VSeeFace is a highly configurable face and hand tracking VRM avatar puppeteering program for virtual youtubers with a focus on robust tracking and high image quality. VSeeFace offers functionality similar to Luppet, 3tene, Wakaru and similar programs. VSeeFace runs on Windows 8 and above (64 bit only). It probably runs on Windows 7 too.

Downloads can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/emilianavt/VSeeFaceReleases/releases) section.

While VSeeFace is not itself open source, the core face tracking library [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace) is.
